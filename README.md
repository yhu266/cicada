A collection of data structures and algorithms implemented in C.

## features

1. common data structures
	+ dynamic string
	+ doubly linked list
	+ C++ inspired vector
	+ trees
		- AVL
		- red-black
2. common algorithms
	+ swaps
	+ merging
	+ searching
	+ sorts
		- heap
		- quick
		- merge
		- bubble
		- insertion

## motivation

I was bored. I wanted to get better at algorithms. I wanted to get better at C because I was reading an OS book. I also wanted to pick up CLRS.

## testing

**requirements** - a variadiac macro compliant C compiler

The wonderful [Acutest](https://github.com/mity/acutest) framework is used for conducting unit tests.

```
cd tests
make test
```

## documentation

Coming soon.
